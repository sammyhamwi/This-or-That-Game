# This or That Game
#### Social interaction game focused on bringing people with dementia together
&nbsp;
This or That focuses on creating an easy way for people with dementia to sit together and talk about different subjects.

The game focuses on choosing a category and then two images are shown: one with a blue border and one with a red border.
You choose which one you prefer. There are no right or wrong answers, everything is correct as long as it brings 
healthy conversation. After choosing your answer, the players explain why.

> This is still a very initial design and deployment
> and it is important to note that this is still
> a very early prototype version of the game.
> There are still many technological and design
> improvements to be done in the future.
