# This or That Game
#### Social interaction game focused on bringing people with dementia together
&nbsp;
This or That is designed to foster social engagement among individuals with dementia, providing a simple and enjoyable way for participants to sit together and discuss a variety of topics.

In the game, players select a category, then two images are displayedâ€”one with a blue border and one with a red border. Players choose the image they prefer, with no right or wrong answers. 
The goal is to encourage conversation, as participants explain the reasons behind their choices, promoting healthy discussion.

> Please note that this is an early-stage prototype, and both technological
> and design improvements are planned for future development.
