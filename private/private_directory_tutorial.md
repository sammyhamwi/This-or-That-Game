To initialize this /private directory you will need to do the following:

- Add a two files named 'password.txt' and 'stats_password.txt' to /private
- The content of /private/password.txt should be the password to enter the site
- The content of /private/stats_password.txt should be the password to enter the vote stats page

This is required for the app to run properly.
